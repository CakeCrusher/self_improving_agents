The oceans, covering approximately 71% of the Earth's surface, play a crucial role in regulating the planet's climate and supporting biodiversity. However, the increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases due to anthropogenic activities are leading to rising global temperatures, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and altered ocean currents. Each of these factors profoundly impacts marine ecosystems, threatening the myriad of species that inhabit the oceans and the human communities that depend on them.\n\nAs Dr. Sylvia Earle, a renowned marine biologist, aptly stated:\n\n> \"With every drop of water you drink, every breath you take, you're connected to the sea. No matter where on Earth you live.\"\n\nThis connection underscores the urgency of addressing the impacts of climate change on marine environments.\n\n## Body\n\n### 1. Rising Ocean Temperatures\n\nIncreasing ocean temperatures are one of the most significant outcomes of climate change. With over 90% of excess heat from global warming absorbed by the oceans, marine ecosystems are undergoing critical changes:\n\n- **Coral Bleaching**: The warming waters lead to coral bleaching, a phenomenon where corals expel algae living in their tissues, causing them to turn white and often die. As per recent studies, coral reefs could be almost entirely wiped out by 2050 if current temperature trends continue.\n\n    - Bleached corals lose their primary food source and are more susceptible to disease.\n    - The collapse of coral reefs affects biodiversity, as they support about 25% of all marine species.\n\n- **Migration of Marine Species**: Many species are migrating towards the poles or to deeper waters in search of cooler environments. This migration disrupts existing ecosystems and affects commercial fisheries, altering food security for millions of people globally.\n\n### 2. Ocean Acidification\n\nOcean acidification is another detrimental effect of climate change, resulting from the oceans absorbing approximately 30% of human-emitted carbon dioxide (CO2):\n\n- **Impact on Marine Life**:\n  - Shell-forming organisms such as mollusks, echinoderms, and corals are particularly vulnerable. The acidification reduces the availability of carbonate ions, which are essential for forming calcium carbonate shells and skeletons.\n  - A study published in *Science* highlights that ocean acidification adversely impacts the sensory organs of fish, impairing behaviors crucial for survival, such as predator avoidance and habitat selection.\n\n- **Food Web Disruption**: The decline in populations of shellfish and other marine organisms reverberates through the food web, affecting everything from primary consumers to apex predators. This chain reaction impacts commercial fisheries and global food supplies.\n\n### 3. Sea-Level Rise and Habitat Loss\n\nSea-level rise is primarily driven by the melting of polar ice caps and thermal expansion due to warming oceans:\n\n- **Coastal Ecosystems**:\n  - Tidal flats, salt marshes, and mangrove forests are increasingly eroded. These habitats serve as crucial breeding and nursery grounds for numerous fish species and offer protection against storm surges.\n  - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that a significant percentage of the world's coastal ecosystems could be submerged or severely damaged by the end of the century.\n\n- **Human Impacts**: Coastal communities, especially in developing regions, face displacement. Loss of habitat not only affects ecosystem services but also leads to socioeconomic challenges.\n\n### 4. Altered Ocean Currents\n\nChanges in temperature and salinity are altering oceanic currents, which are vital for distributing heat across the globe and supporting marine biodiversity:\n\n- **Impact on Climate Patterns**: Altered currents affect global climate patterns, leading to increased frequency and intensity of weather events such as hurricanes, which further stress marine ecosystems.\n- **Disruption of Nutrient Cycles**: The alteration of ocean currents disrupts nutrient upwelling and distribution, affecting phytoplankton blooms that form the base of marine food webs.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, climate change poses a multifaceted threat to ocean ecosystems, with rising temperatures, acidification, sea-level rise, and altered currents creating cascading impacts throughout the marine environment. This situation demands urgent global action to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and implement conservation strategies to preserve and restore ocean health.\n\nAs Jacques-Yves Cousteau once said:\n\n> \"People protect what they love.\"\n\nRecognizing our intrinsic connection to the oceans will be instrumental in fostering a collective responsibility to safeguard these vital ecosystems for future generations. As we continue to advance our understanding of the complex interactions between climate change and marine environments, a concerted effort among nations, communities, and individuals is crucial in curbing these impacts and ensuring the sustainability of ocean ecosystems.\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example Variation (Graded score 1, Completely Different Formatting):\n\n```\n**Ocean Ecosystems Under Siege by Climate Change**\n\nOur oceans, making up nearly three-quarters of Earth's surface, are critical to planetary health and biodiversity. Yet, human-induced climate change threatens these waters profoundly.\n\nMarine biologist Sylvia Earle emphasizes our dependency:\n\n> \"Every breath, every sip of water, links us back to the sea.\"\n\n### Ocean Warming\n\nOceans trap most excess global heat, endangering marine life:\n\n- **Coral Catastrophes**: Rising temperatures cause coral bleaching, potentially decimating reefs by 2050 and devastating marine biodiversity.\n- **Species on the Move**: Marine species migrate poleward, disrupting fisheries and global food security.\n\n### Acidification of Waters\n\nAbout 30% of atmospheric CO₂ is absorbed by oceans, becoming acidic:\n\n- **Life Under Threat**: Shell-building creatures struggle, with weakened defenses and impaired fish behaviors disrupting food webs.\n- **Ecosystem Chain Reaction**: Collapse of these organisms severely impacts fisheries and human food resources.\n\n### Rising Seas\n\nMelting ice and thermal ocean expansion raise sea levels:\n\n- **Loss of Coastal Habitats**: Vital ecosystems like mangroves and marshes face inundation, threatening wildlife and humans alike.\n- **Societal Consequences**: Coastal flooding causes displacement, impacting economic and social stability.\n\n### Disrupted Currents\n\nClimate-induced changes alter ocean currents:\n\n- **Weather Extremes**: Intensified storms and disrupted climate patterns emerge.\n- **Nutrient Imbalance**: Nutrient cycles affected, undermining essential phytoplankton populations.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe urgent need to tackle climate change grows clearer as oceans face unprecedented threats.

Changes in Ocean Currents\n\nOceanic current shifts due to temperature and salinity changes significantly impact climate and marine life:\n\n- **Climate Pattern Alterations**: Disrupted currents amplify extreme weather events, placing further stress on marine ecosystems.\n- **Nutrient Distribution Effects**: Altered currents compromise nutrient circulation, affecting critical phytoplankton populations foundational to marine food webs.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nClimate change presents an extensive threat to marine ecosystems through temperature increases, acidification, rising seas, and altered currents. Immediate global action on greenhouse gas reduction and marine conservation strategies is crucial.\n\nAs Jacques-Yves Cousteau emphasized:\n\n> \"We safeguard that which we love.\"\n\nAcknowledging our oceanic connections fosters collective responsibility toward preserving marine ecosystems. Unified global action remains imperative for oceanic sustainability.\n\n```\n\nFormatting Consistency Score: 5\n\nReasoning:\nThe formatting exactly matches the original, including headings, subheadings, block quotes, lists, and overall structural organization.\n\n---\n\nNow, I will provide you with the user-provided original version and its rewritten version.\n\n---\n\n### Original Chat Completions Input text:\n\n```\n{attributes.llm.input_messages}\n```\n\n---\n\n### New Rewritten output in Chat Completions format:\n\n```\n{attributes.llm.output_messages}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Task:\n\nProvide a formatting consistency score (1-5) for the new rewritten version.\n",
