However, there are slight variations in the labeling of sections (e.g., 'A.' instead of '1.' for the first section) and the overall phrasing of the content. Despite these differences, the core formatting elements remain consistent, leading to a score of 4 for overall similarity in formatting.",

The overall organization is consistent, but the differences in heading styles and the lack of a clear separation between sections (like paragraphs) slightly detract from the consistency.
